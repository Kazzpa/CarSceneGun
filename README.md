# CarSceneGun
A simple car scene with simple code so i can learn how to make a simple game using Unity.
## Inactive repository
This repository was used to learn about game development in unity, building a simple car racing game where i explored ways to add features to a basic game. Code isn't perfect nor an example of how to code a game. 
## Working:
* Nitros that can be used whenever you want
* SpeedBoost on the road, activated automatically
* Speed Handler
* Restart game without reloading the entire scene.
